# Password_Generator
This is a beginner project which I made which allowed me to learn the very basics and revisit topics of python

## Features
- User-defined password length.
- Option to include numbers and special characters.
  
## What I Learned
- Using Python's `random` and `string` modules.
- Handling user input and error validation.
- Writing modular code with functions.

## Example Output
Enter the length of password (minimum 1): 10
Do you want your password to have numbers (y/n)? y
Do you want your password to have special characters (y/n)? y
Your generated password is: uM}3|{%8so
